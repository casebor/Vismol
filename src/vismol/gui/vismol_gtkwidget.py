# [EN] macOS/Quartz fix: GTK3's Quartz backend has a long-standing bug
# where realizing a Gtk.GLArea corrupts Cairo/window compositing for the
# ENTIRE containing NSWindow, leaving it permanently blank (reproduces
# with a bare Gtk.Window containing nothing but a GLArea -- no
# EasyHybrid/Vismol code involved). GTK4 has a real fix (GSK_RENDERER=gl)
# but GTK3 has no equivalent, and running under XQuartz/X11 instead of
# Quartz was also tried and rejected (GTK3's X11 GL path segfaults on
# first draw on macOS). Neither backend has a working GtkGLArea on this
# platform. Worked around by rendering OpenGL OUTSIDE of GTK's own
# compositing entirely on macOS: VismolGTKWidget becomes a plain
# Gtk.DrawingArea there, owning a hidden GLFW window purely to hold an
# OpenGL context that's never attached to any GTK/AppKit view (see
# _OffscreenGLContext below); the finished frame is read back with
# glReadPixels and blitted into the DrawingArea's Cairo context. Linux/
# Windows are completely unaffected -- this constant is decided once, at
# import time, and every macOS-only code path below is gated behind it.
